# **Taxi Revenue Optimization ðŸš•ðŸ’°**  
*Leveraging Deep Q-Learning and Data Visualization for Optimal Trip Selection & Revenue Maximization*  

##  **Overview**  
This project applies **Deep Q-Learning (DQL)** to optimize taxi trip selection and maximize revenue. By learning from **historical trip data**, the model predicts the most profitable trips while considering factors like **fare, distance, surge pricing, and demand hotspots**. Additionally, **enhanced data visualization** is integrated to provide insights into taxi performance, high-revenue areas, and customer demand patterns.  

##  **Features**  
 **Deep Q-Learning Model** â€“ Uses reinforcement learning to optimize trip selection.  
 **Revenue & Demand Prediction** â€“ Identifies high-earning trips based on historical patterns.  
 **Surge Pricing Analysis** â€“ Evaluates optimal times and locations for maximizing earnings.  
 **Data-Driven Insights** â€“ Visualizes fare trends, demand hotspots, and trip efficiency.  
 **Scalable & Deployable** â€“ Model can be integrated into ride-hailing platforms or taxi dispatch systems.
